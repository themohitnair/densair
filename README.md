Your reading assistant for Research Papers that intimidate and intrigue you.

## Motivation

Been procrastinating reading a paper because it looks very intimidating? Not able to even open the paper because your heart starts thumping at the sight of all that jargon? No worries. Densair is here.

Here's what densAIr allows you to do with ArXiv papers:

1. Generate summaries about the overall paper, and specific parts - like those gnarly tables and diagrams, and those sections starting with big words (Methodology, Abstract and Conclusion).
2. Enhance in-depth understanding with key terms required to comprehend the paper with curated resources.
3. Chat with the paper with the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Go try it out!
